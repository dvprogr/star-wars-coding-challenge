# Coding Challenge - David Murad

This is the repo for the coding challenge "Star Wars themed React App"

# # Task

Please implement a Star Wars themed React App. The App should connect to https://swapi.dev/ or https://swapi.py4e.com/api and display the retrieved data. Please do not invest more than 4-8 hours on this. Also, keep the design effort to a minimum and use a pragmatic approach to your app's design. If you need to cut anything from the implementation or make any assumptions due to time constraints, please make a note and let us know later when presenting your solution to us. Treat this as a showcase for your working style and as a chance to show off your skills as a developer. Of course you don’t have to overdo it. In the end, we know that you have to work on it next to your daily life. A simple solution is perfectly fine. Should you hit a roadblock don’t hesitate to ask us. Please commit your code to a public github repository and provide us with the link.
